## Is this book for you?

This book is for people who work in software organizations, and who belive that there is a better way to work together!

Read it and you will learn how to use Event Storming to break silos and to find the middle way between centralization and chaos.

> What if I don't have a technical background?

Event Storming emerged from the Domain-Driven Design community, which mostly consists of developers and architects. Yet, one objective of this book is to bring Event Storming to the masses, out of the technical circles.

## Preamble: how to read this book?

**You are not holding a book. You are holding a toolbox!**

![a set of tools avaialble to pick.]({{site.url}}/assets/images/tools_64072.png)

Event Storming can be used to address a variety of challenges. Like a tool that you use for a specific task, each of the following reading paths targets a specific need or challenge.

Our goal with this book is to offer practical and applicable guidance while keeping the reading time under 1 hour, so:

- If you need a **quick 10 min introduction to what Event Storming is about**, read
  - [The essence of Event storming]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/foundations/essence-of-event-storming/),
  - [Why would you want to run a Big-Picture event storming?]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/big%20picture/why-would-you-want-to-run-a-big-picture-event-storming/) And [a Design-Level Event Storming?]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/software%20design/why-should-you-run-a-design-level-event-storming/) and [3 questions to know if Event Storming the Flow can help you]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/workflow%20improvement/3-questions-to-know-if-event-storming-the-flow-could-help-you/).

- For a **comprehensive overview of event storming**: Start with [The essence of Event storming]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/foundations/essence-of-event-storming/) and then move to [Big picture Event Storming](#2-big-picture-event-storming).

- If you are interested in **improving collaboration when doing architecture**: 
  - Dive into [Big picture Event Storming](#2-big-picture-event-storming) to explore the problem space with a large audience.
  - Or read [Design Level Event Storming](#3-design-level-event-storming) to dive into the Domain Driven Design for a core functional area.

- To **optimize workflows**: begin with [Event Storming the flow](#4-event-storming-the-flow) and to then [Identify where to act to improve your workflow]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/workflow%20improvement/identify-where-to-act-to-unlock-your-workflow/).

- For **remote facilitation**: go directly to [Rethinking Event Storming in Remote](#5-rethinking-event-storming-in-remote). In case you are completely new to event storming, we advise you to start with one of the above proposals first.

- For **general tips and best practices to improve your practice of event storming**: check out [General tips](#6-general-tips) and, more specifically, [popular Event Storming facilitation tips you need to know]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/foundations/popular-event-storming-facilitation-tips-you-need-to-know/).
