## Is this book for you?

This book is for people who work in software organizations, and who belive that there is a better way to work together!

Read it and you will learn how to use Event Storming to break silos and to find the middle way between centralization and chaos.

> What if I don't have a technical background?

Event Storming emerged from the Domain-Driven Design community, which mostly consists of developers and architects. Yet, one objective of this book is to bring Event Storming to the masses, out of the technical circles.
