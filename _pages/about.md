# About us 

We are Philippe and Matthieu, 2 agile coaches working at Murex. 

Philippe specializes in technical coaching. He owns a [blog](https://philippe.bourgau.net/) and is a regular speaker at software development conferences. 

Matthieu is skilled in agile product management and professional coaching. 

We both learnt agility by practicing it as members of operational software development teams. For this reason, we appreciate concrete stuff. And we do our best for this blog to be practical and connected to the ground.
