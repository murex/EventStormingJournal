> Let‚Äôs run our ES at the next company yearly retreat‚Ä¶ That is in 9 months!‚Äù Wait a second, wasn‚Äôt Event Storming supposed to speed up decision-making?

Let‚Äôs not kid ourselves; since COVID, hybrid work has become the default. Many teams are now distributed, and there are always people working from home. **Running an Event Storming with everybody at the same place and time has become a real challenge**.

At first, we were skeptical about adapting the workshop to remote. Yet, as we experimented, we discovered remote Event Storming had many great benefits. With good preparation, your results will be at least as good as when co-located.

### Why run an Event Storming remotely?

#### The shortcomings of co-located Event Storming

First, in-person Event Storming comes with a lot of practical constraints:

- Your team might be spread over many places, maybe in different countries. Organizing to get everyone at the same place and time adds waste:
  - **Traveling and accommodation** will cost money and organization time.
  - You'll have to schedule a few weeks in advance to accommodate everyone‚Äôs agenda. This will delay the decisions you can make in the workshop!
- The situation is not that much better if you all work at the same place! People might work from home regularly, so you'll still have to organize around this.
- Finally, co-located Event Storming logistics might be problematic. For example, finding an adequate room in your office can be difficult, so you‚Äôll need to rent a place!

#### Doing Event Storming regularly

**In a hybrid world, remote is the only option to leverage Event Storming as a regular practice**. For example:

- Co-location is a real constraint if you want to run a quick refresh to finish a task or feature.
- Or if you want to integrate Event Storming as a quarterly practice.
- Here's another: you‚Äôve just finished a co-located [Big Picture Event Storming](#big-picture). You‚Äôve decided to follow up with a [Desing Level](#design-level). Unfortunately, everyone is already returning to their homes!

### Remote ES as an opportunity

#### The obvious advantages

Let‚Äôs start with the obvious: without travel and a big room to rent, remote Event Storming is

- **Cheaper**.
- **Greener**.
- And it saves you from all the physical setup of an in-person Event Storming.

![Photo of a light bulb with tree leaves instead of the filament. By avoiding business trips, remote Event Storming is way better for the planet!](./imgs/2024-11-23-why-go-remote-with-event-storming-the-surprising-benefits/plant-bulb.jpg)

#### Running Event Storming regularly

With **lower preparation time and budget**, you can run Event Storming more regularly! As mentioned above:

- ‚ÄúRefresh‚Äù your Event Storming every quarter.
- Dive into a bounded context with [Design-Level](#design-level) at [the last responsible moment.](https://blog.codinghorror.com/the-last-responsible-moment/)

#### Leverage digital tools

Then, remote workshops rely on two main tools: a virtual whiteboard (Miro, Mural‚Ä¶) and videoconferences (Zoom, Teams‚Ä¶). These tools come with **plenty of built-in digital benefits**:

- A persistent design board.
- ‚ÄúReal‚Äù infinite design space!
- The board is easy to export or copy, which enables sharing with a larger community.
- We reuse and improve board templates from one workshop to the next!
- It‚Äôs possible to record the sessions to archive how we arrived at some decisions.
- New AI features are appearing, like summarizing stickies or capturing transcripts of workshops.

#### More Time for Deep thinking

In-person Event Storming is an intense face-to-face communication exercise. Remote Event Storming, however, gives more space for other ways of thinking. As a facilitator, you can leverage this! For example, by asking: ‚ÄúBefore the next session, can anyone find an answer to the question raised by this hotspot sticky?‚Äù In more detail:

- It leaves **more time for solo and deep thinking**.
- Asynchronous ‚Äúresearch‚Äù reduces communication bottlenecks (when everybody listens or waits for someone else).

![Photo of a man siting cross-legged on the stomp of a tree, thinking. Remote Event Storming leaves more time for deep thinking than the intensive 2 days co-located workshop.](./imgs/2024-11-23-why-go-remote-with-event-storming-the-surprising-benefits/thinking.jpg)

#### More inclusive

Finally, **remote is more inclusive!**

- Some people need specific equipment to work. Others have difficulties in crowded places. Remote help these people take part in the workshop.
- Letting everyone contribute harnesses **neurodiversity, which improves collective decision-making**.

> _If you have someone in your team with a disability, just adapt the work environment so they can do their job. For everything else, keep it exactly the same. In the Paralympics sports, adapting to the environment means we compete among people with similar disabilities. For the rest, we do exactly the same as any other high-performing athlete who would have no disability._ - Marie-Am√©lie Le Fur, President of French Paralympic committee.

#### Remote Event Storming will make you a better facilitator

Remote Event Storming will also benefit you as a facilitator. **Remote facilitation will teach you lessons you can also apply when co-located!**

For example, we had to learn how to give more explicit instructions. Once we took on this habit, we discovered it also improved our co-located sessions!

Here is another example: energy often dips during the Storytelling phase. When co-located, we accepted it as a necessary step in the workshop. In remote, it always happens and destroys people‚Äôs attention. So we combined breakout rooms for different board areas with ‚ÄúShift and Share.‚Äù (Shift and Share is an organized way for all groups to visit the other rooms). This also improves the workshop when co-located, especially with a large audience!

### So, what are the limitations of remote Event Storming?

#### Reduced Team building

There are plenty of tips to make remote Event Storming more fun and make people feel connected. Yet, it‚Äôs impossible to reproduce the same human bonding experience as when we all are in the same room.

A co-located workshop, where everyone tackles the same challenge, is excellent for team-building! It‚Äôs often also the occasion to go outside and eat together.

![Screenshot from Rachel Davies's talk "Sustaining Remote ‚Äì First Teams" at Agile on the Beach 2019. It shows a remote team that gathered for a co-located "retreat"](./imgs/2024-11-23-why-go-remote-with-event-storming-the-surprising-benefits/sustaining-remote-miniature.jpg)
<div class="figcaption">[Watch the full talk](https://youtu.be/ZtsroDkCcRs?si=_vkn2aaK5cpre4U-)</div>

#### No self-organization

Event-Storming participants naturally self-organize in smaller groups to tackle the different subjects. People will walk around, read what‚Äôs on the board, bump into each other, and start discussing stickies. Unfortunately, this will not happen when remote. These sub-group discussions will need to be explicitly facilitated! This is the primary rule of remote facilitation:

> üí°**What was implicit needs to become implicit!**

That‚Äôs why remote Event Storming facilitation is not easy! It will need more preparation, structure, and guidance. Yet, don't worry, we have your back! The following chapters will guide you through facilitating a remote Event Storming.

### Embrace remote Event Storming

The in-person Event Storming experience, intensity, and team building are irreplaceable. Yet, our practice shows that doing it remotely is possible. Remote Event Storming compensates with unsuspected benefits. With good preparation and adaptation, remote Event Storming rocks! Let's see how to facilitate it.

## Remote Event Storming Simplified: 7 Essential Practices

::: {.lead-statement data-latex=""}
‚ÑπÔ∏è **In this chapter:** _Here are 7 fundamental practices for remote Event Storming that increase delegation, reduce fatigue, improve documentation, and boost autonomy for any workshop._
:::

![Screenshot of a virtual whiteboard with stickies containing this chapter's title and the 7 practices: 7 Essential Practices for Remote Event Storming, Short Sessions, Breakout Rooms, Collaboration Roles, Silent Sorting, Self Explanatory Board, Practice Session, Co-Facilitation.](./imgs/2025-02-14-remote-event-storming-simplified-7-essential-practices/7-essential-practices-for-remote-event-storming-miro.jpg)

We just mentioned a key rule of remote facilitation: **‚ÄúWhat is implicit must become explicit!‚Äù. As a facilitator, you must take the extra step to trigger collaboration that would naturally happen if people were co-located**. For example, you cannot bring beverages and food to the workshop and expect people to take some when needed. Instead, you‚Äôll have to explicitly ask them to gather some at their desks from the beginning!

Here are seven essential practices that make the implicit explicit when running an ES in remote:

1. Split into short sessions
2. Regularly break out into topic rooms
3. Assign collaboration roles
4. Merge work with Silent Sorting
5. Keep the board self-explanatory
6. Make participants practice first
7. Find a Co-Facilitator

Let‚Äôs now see how to use these 7 ‚Äúexplicit‚Äù practices for real!

### Split into short sessions

Having everybody for two days in a co-located Event Storming is incredibly effective. It‚Äôs also quite exhausting! Trying to mimic the same focus remotely will leave everybody on their knees. There is no way a human can sustain their attention through a screen for 8 hours.

So, **book short sessions! We recommend 1h30 sessions**. For example, instead of a two-day workshop, schedule daily sessions for two weeks or twice daily for one week. As mentioned in the previous chapter, this lets you leverage the time between sessions by:

- Asking participants to look up more data.
- Adapting the workshop agenda.

### Regularly break out into topic rooms

One of the great forces of Event Storming is that unique groups of people emerge to tackle the problems at hand. How can we replicate this in a remote setting?

![A group of people standing together. Creating team-sized groups to work in breakout room is crucial to keep the workshop effective.](./imgs/2025-02-14-remote-event-storming-simplified-7-essential-practices/team.jpg)

We can use the [Open Space activity](https://www.liberatingstructures.com/25-open-space-technology/) to make the group creation explicit. It‚Äôs composed of two phases:

1. The pitch: anybody can propose and present ‚Äúroom‚Äù topics
2. The breakout: participants join whichever room they want

You can find more details about how to run a remote Open Space on [Philippe‚Äôs blog](https://philippe.bourgau.net/how-to-run-a-remote-first-open-space-technology-un-conference/). **The idea for remote Event Storming is to run every session (as described above) as an Open Space**. The typical Open Space has no pre-defined goal; one of its rules is ‚ÄúWhatever happens is the right thing.‚Äù However, as an Event Storming facilitator, you have a goal and an agenda! You will need to twist the Open Space so that people follow the Event Storming steps:

1. For some phases of the workshop, you will be prescriptive about room topics
2. You will organize knowledge sharing between rooms after every breakout
3. You will need some follow-up about what happens in the room

In more detail:

1. **Gather and share the workgroup topics**. And, at first, be prescriptive about the room topics. Yet, let people suggest their topics more and more as you progress through the Event Storming. You will need a visual marketplace to list the topics.
    - At the beginning, split the board by zone (example: left, middle, right). Each room can focus on one part of the board.
    - Later, split by functional area and associate each room to one or more areas.
    - At the end, let people come up with their topics.
2. **Let people self-assign to the various workgroups**. In the beginning, insist on having similar-sized groups. Become less and less strict as topics emerge from the participants.
3. **Let them work in breakout rooms**. And visit the groups to make sure things are going well.
4. **Organize a [Shift and Share](https://www.liberatingstructures.com/11-shift-share/)**. Leave an ‚Äúowner‚Äù in each room, and ask the others to ‚Äúvisit‚Äù the other rooms for a chat. This will cross-pollinate all the knowledge that emerged from the different rooms. Learn more about facilitating this on the Liberating Structures website.
5. **Gather follow-up stickies**. Collect pink ‚Äúproblem‚Äù stickies from all the rooms. In this setup, it‚Äôs also a good practice to do the same with ‚Äúdecision‚Äù stickies: we use green ones. Collect them in a central space. Problem stickies are great candidates for room topics in the next session.

We find this sequence of activities central to facilitating a remote Event Storming. Once in place, **this rhythm becomes the ‚Äúpulse‚Äù of the Event Storming**.

Side note: you can reuse this structure for many collaborative design activities!

### Assign collaboration roles

In a co-located Event Storming, there is only one role aside from facilitator: participant. Everybody should create stickies and change the design board.

Here‚Äôs a story from the first remote Event Storming we facilitated. After a few sessions, we realized that, with their computers at their fingertips, participants were not as engaging as we were expecting. A small group was running the show while others were taking a backseat. The overall experience was slow and exhausting. We decided to start the next session with a mini-training about [Delegated Missions](https://www.metasysteme-coaching.fr/francais/coaching-et-management-d-equipe-les-processus-delegues/). We explained to participants that they had to self-organize with these roles in the work groups. It tremendously improved the workshop: participants improved their feedback on the sessions, and we were progressing faster!

> I had a glimpse at the epiphany of remote work. (feedback from a participant at the end of the workshop)

**Small work groups are already making things better. Let‚Äôs go further by assigning explicit participation roles**. Here are two schemas that work well; pick the one you feel most at ease with:

![A lion and bear puppets. Assigning collaboration roles to participants in work groups is key to have them self-organize when the facilitator is not present.](./imgs/2025-02-14-remote-event-storming-simplified-7-essential-practices/puppets.jpg)

#### Option 1: The ‚Äúmob‚Äù

This one builds on the rules of Mob Programming. You can find the details of this technique on [Nick Tune‚Äôs blog](https://medium.com/nick-tune-tech-strategy-blog/remote-team-flow-eventstorming-for-retrospectives-a8ea33cdb277). The roles are:

- One Storyteller who says what happens in the domain.
- One ‚Äúfacilitator‚Äù takes notes with stickies and ensures the session is on track.
- The other participants (the ‚ÄúMob‚Äù) can interrupt, ask questions and give feedback.

They should switch the roles every few minutes; a timer is useful!

#### Option 2: The Delegated Missions

This one is slightly more involved but also more collaborative. Matthieu wrote a [complete guide about it](https://www.eventstormingjournal.com/foundations/engage-the-participants-during-your-next-event-storming-thanks-to-the-delegated-missions/). Here, different people take on different roles for the five ingredients of collaboration:

- The facilitator: structures the interactions and finds volunteers for the other roles
- The timekeeper: gives rhythm and makes sure things happen on time
- The intent keeper: shares the goal and makes sure the workshop progresses towards it
- The decision pusher: triggers decisions
- The meta feedbacker: shares feedback and improvement options based on their observation

They can keep the roles for the duration of a breakout.

### Merge work with Silent Sorting

![A close-up of a person with her finger on her lips. Silent Sorting is one of these activities that looks weird when co-located, but that makes wonders in remote!](./imgs/2025-02-14-remote-event-storming-simplified-7-essential-practices/silent.jpg)

We commit to recombining the results when we break out into topic rooms. You don‚Äôt want a single person to read through everything while everyone else listens. **Silent Sorting is a recombining practice that does wonders in remote**. It‚Äôs one of the few practices that works better remotely than in person! Here is how its magic goes:

1. Give a few minutes for everyone to silently read through what the others created
2. Still silently, ask everyone to move any sticky to organize them in a coherent whole
3. Finally, let people discuss the problematic points.

This works well to recombine work on different parts of the design board. It also works well to merge the output of various groups working on the same task. Here are some examples:

- At the beginning of the workshop, we create sub-groups to sort events chronologically. When the groups join, use silent sorting to organize all the events in a coherent timeline.
- There is a step to flag the bounded contexts as generic, supportive, or core. People do this alone, in pairs, small groups, and all together. At each step, silent sorting is used to merge the design of the smaller groups.

### Keep the board self-explanatory

To participants, breakout work implies that a lot happens in ‚Äúother rooms.‚Äù The primary way to catch up is by reading the board. Keeping the board clear saves plenty of questions and answers.

So, as much as possible, **strive for a self-explanatory design board**. Explain this to participants. Repeatedly remind them to make the board easy to understand. As a facilitator, play "the silliest person in the room,‚Äù ask questions, and clarify the board.

If it feels worth it, you can also ask all participants to take 5 minutes of all-hands "tidy the board" time. Propose they add clarifying notes as they go. If needed, they can add questions on pink stickies.

### Make participants practice first

The good practices for a remote or co-located workshop are different! **Intense remote collaboration is something new to most participants. Make the participants practice these workshop techniques before starting the actual Event Storming!**

Do you remember our above story with Delegated Missions during our first remote Event Storming? Getting our audience to practice for 10 minutes was key to giving the participants the autonomy to use the techniques.

![A group of musician on stage for a rehearsal. Althought counterintuitive, but getting participants through mini-practice of the remote workshop techniques before will make the Event Storming more time efficient!](./imgs/2025-02-14-remote-event-storming-simplified-7-essential-practices/rehearsal.jpg)

Here are three of the above techniques that are worth practicing before:

- **Group forming.** Make them practice a loop of Open Space, Shift & Share, and stickies collection.
- **Roles.** Get them through a co-creation activity, using the mob or delegated missions roles.
- **Synthesis.** To merge, get them through a co-design activity using the 1-2-4-all scheme and Silent Sorting.

It's also worth practicing technology and setup:

- An **online whiteboard tool** ([Miro](https://miro.com/), [Mural](https://www.mural.co/), ‚Ä¶). Even if the tools are relatively intuitive, they take a bit of practice to use very well. For example, how to ‚Äúfollow‚Äù someone else, hide cursors, and navigate quickly‚Ä¶
- Finally, practice is a way to test the **physical setup** of each participant. We recommend two screens:
  - one with the online whiteboard
  - and another with the videos of the participants.

You can make them practice for 5 minutes at the beginning of each session. You'll have to split the full practice depending on what will happen next. You can also make them practice all the above in advance. This could be a sort of ‚Äúmini-training‚Äù for remote workshops.

### Find a Co-Facilitator

You might be wondering:

> All this remote facilitation might seem like more work. How will I manage it all?

You don‚Äôt have to! **Get a co-facilitator or even many co-facilitators**. This has plenty of benefits:

- Share the workload
- Be present in different breakout rooms at the same time
- Keep the board tidier
- Make sure that participants follow the proper collaboration patterns
- Provide a different perspective
- Avoid mistakes by asking your co-facilitator, ‚ÄúDo you have anything to add? Did I forget anything? Did I get it all right?‚Äù
- Have a pair to discuss how to adapt the workshop between sessions

Finally, not doing this alone is also more fun and less stressful!

### The benefits of making the implicit explicit

![A person handing out a gift box. Making everything explicit comes with plenty of benefits for all parties.](./imgs/2025-02-14-remote-event-storming-simplified-7-essential-practices/gift.jpg)

At first sight, all these practices might seem cumbersome, unnatural, and extra work! Yet, when paying closer attention, they maximize the overall value of the workshop.

#### For the facilitator

For example, work should be more sustainable during the workshop itself:

- You will **delegate much facilitation** to the participants and your co-facilitator.
- Also, **short and regular sessions** save us from the two-day Event Storming marathon.

#### For the participants

These practices increase the workshop‚Äôs return on investment for participants:

- The explicit facilitation will make participants more autonomous. Meaning they will be more capable of **running an Event Storming by themselves** in the future
- Keeping **the board tidy and explicit is self-documentation**. Take a snapshot to record the workshop output.

#### Finally, for the organization

Making the Event Storming explicit will turn it into a learning experience!

- Participants will learn **reusable remote workshop skills**. This will make them more effective in their day-to-day work!

### Do you feel ready?

These techniques are the essence of effective remote facilitation! Do you feel ready to run your first remote Event Storming? If so, go ahead! Otherwise, read-on, we will go through the agenda in detail and dig into specific aspects.
