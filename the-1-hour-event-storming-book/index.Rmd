# Why this book?

Close collaboration between business and tech is great on paper... but how do you do it, concretely?

Event Storming looks like a great way to get started, but it's a scary beast to master! How do I actually run this workshop with more than 10 people?

This mini e-book is a step by step guide that will successfully lead you through your first Event Storming!

* It's short to be short and will read it in less than 1 hour
* It covers the 3 main flavors of Event Storming
* It contains a chapter about remote facilitations
* It will save you from typical mistakes with 25 facilitation tips that we learnt the hard way

And guess what? It even contains drawings! Start reading now, and in 1 hour, you'll be ready to run your first Event Storming.
