# Preamble

## How to read this book

TODO:

- supposed 1h, a bit longer... but we wanted to keep it very detailed and ready to use
- we also had to add the remote part, which we decided we had to do very detailed as well
- can pick the right flavor for you, should stick to 1h
- can skip the tips at first (should we provide an index of tips?)
- ment to be very detailed facilitation guide

## If you are reading the epub version

We took some time to style the book so we advice you to use an epub reader and settings that respect the original style as much as possible. Here is where we tested that it renders well:
- On iOS and MacOS, the "Books" app works great, just select the original style
- On Windows, the "Freda" ebook reader has an option to use the "publisher's style"
- Overall, it renders better on a clear background

That said, epub is meant to be customizable, so it's up to you!
