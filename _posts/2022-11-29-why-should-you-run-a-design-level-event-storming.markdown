*Design Level Event Storming is a workshop to design the core of your system. What is it exactly? What are its outcomes? Where should you use it?*

![Drawing of a DDD Event Storming board with a loop on one Bounded Context. Design Level Event Storming is about diving in the details of a core Bounded Context]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/imgs/2022-11-29-why-should-you-run-a-design-level-event-storming/design-level-event-storming-zoom.jpeg)

Imagine you are starting a new product with your team. You had been struggling for a while about how to start.

-   What should the high-level design be?
-   What should we focus on first?
-   What are the main risks?

All these questions remained unanswered until you heard aboutÂ [Event Storming](https://www.eventstorming.com/)!

You decided to tryÂ [Big Picture Event Storming]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/big%20picture/why-would-you-want-to-run-a-big-picture-event-storming/). As a result, you drafted a functional architecture vision in one or two (intense) days! That's more progress than you had made in weeks. Also, you managed toÂ [identify the functional areas in your domain]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/big%20picture/improve-collaboration-with-a-functional-architecture-vision-draft/). Then, youÂ [have highlighted the topics you'll focus on to create your competitive advantage]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/big%20picture/decide-to-build-or-buy-with-big-picture-event-storming/). These are your core bounded contexts.

Everyone on the team now understands where to focus. So, finally, it looks like the teams are ready to start!

> ðŸ’¡ Wait, how do you get from the Big Picture Event Storming to designing and writing software?

![Photo of an athlete in his starting blocks. Big-Picture and Design-Level Event Storming workshop are really about making the best start possible when building systems with Domain-Driven Design (DDD)]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/imgs/2022-11-29-why-should-you-run-a-design-level-event-storming/starting-block.jpg)

Event Storming has more to offer! We can zoom in with Design-Level Event Storming. We'll look into the following questions:

-   [What problems does Design Level Event Storming solve?]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/software%20design/why-should-you-run-a-design-level-event-storming/#what-problems-does-design-level-event-storming-solve)
-   [What are the outcomes of Design Level Event Storming?]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/software%20design/why-should-you-run-a-design-level-event-storming/#what-are-the-outcomes-of-design-level-event-storming)
-   [How does Design Level Event Storming work?]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/software%20design/why-should-you-run-a-design-level-event-storming/#how-does-design-level-event-storming-work)
-   [On which parts of your system should you run a Design Level Event Storming?]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/software%20design/why-should-you-run-a-design-level-event-storming/#on-which-parts-of-your-system-should-you-run-a-design-level-event-storming)

## What problems does Design Level Event Storming solve?

It's a way to create a collaborative design with a whole software team to solve problems like:

-   **How can we make good enough design decisions in 1 day instead of months?**
-   **How can we be sure that everybody on the team understands our target design and pulls in that direction?**
-   **How can we leverage the perspective of everyone and not just of a few experts?**

## What are the outcomes of Design Level Event Storming?

The Design Level flavor of Event Storming lets you **dive into the details of aÂ [bounded context](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/BoundedContext.html)**. Its primary outcome is a good enough and shared design vision. Developers who attend the workshop should be able to start coding straight away.

> ðŸ’¡ Big Picture Event Storming was about exploringÂ [strategic and large-scale
Domain](https://thedomaindrivendesign.io/what-is-strategic-design/) Driven Design; Design-Level Event Storming is aboutÂ [small-scale DDD](https://thedomaindrivendesign.io/what-is-tactical-design/)Â inside a domain.

During your Design Level Event Storming, you will:

-   Detail the information contained in domain events
-   Draft what the screens should display
-   **Identify potential services** in your architecture (aka Aggregates in DDD Vocabulary) and what they should do
-   Identify the need for interaction with external systems, which is the starting point for API design
-   Pinpoint critical issues:Â [the most pressing problems and the primary domain concept definitions](http://philippe.bourgau.net/5-views-to-capture-the-outputs-of-an-event-storming-workshop/).
-   Get the whole team to collaborate and design together
-   **Align all the team towards a shared vision**, which saves tremendous time as developers all nudge the code in the same direction!
-   Set the team on a sustainable pace by finding the perfect balance betweenÂ [Big Up-Front Design]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/big%20picture/why-would-you-want-to-run-a-big-picture-event-storming/)Â andÂ [Emerging Design](http://philippe.bourgau.net/categories/#incremental-software-development)!

**Similarly to Big Picture Event Storming, the Design Level flavor is a time compressor!** It relies on intense and high-bandwidth collaboration. It follows the same dynamic as Big Picture Event Storming, though it's a bit more detailed and technical.

## On which parts of your system should you run a Design Level Event Storming?

Design Level Event Storming is a zoom-in, yet not all system parts require that much attention! Here are three pre-requisites to know on which parts of your system you should run a Design Level Event Storming:

-   First, you identified it as business-strategic and a business differentiator.
-   It's a real functional area about which developers and non-developers can talk and understand each other. It's not a technical brick that only developers can understand
-   It contains complicated domain logic that [deserves Domain Driven Design](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/27638513/when-we-shouldnt-use-domain-driven-design-approach%60) (ex: finance. If there are books written on this domain, it's a clue!)

These checks should look familiar if you ran a Big Picture Event Storming before! This is because they correspond to your core bounded contexts. **Design Level Event Storming is a natural continuation of Big Picture Event Storming.**

If you haven't run a Big Picture Event Storming before, as long as the previous checks are ok, Design Level Event Storming will work! You'll have to start with a quick "mini big picture event storming" on your scope. That's also a way to "redo" a quick Design Level Event Storming to adjust as you progress.

Finally, Design Level Event Storming is particularly well suited to design microservice orÂ [Event-Sourcing](https://martinfowler.com/eaaDev/EventSourcing.html) systems. If you plan to architect your system with these, that's yet another incentive to use Design Level Event Storming.

## Conclusion

If you have identified a functional area of your system that is:

-   **A key business differentiator**
-   It contains **complicated domain logic** that deserves Domain Driven Design

Then run a Design Level Event Storming with the whole team which will build it! In a few hours:

-   **You'll make complex design decisions that would have taken months**
-   **You'll get a head-start on design**
-   **Everybody will be moving in the same direction**

We'll soon write about how to facilitate your first Design Level Event Storming!
