Did you ever facilitate an Event-Storming that felt more like light freezing rain than a tropical storm?

Event Storming is terrific... when it works! How do you ensure that all participants contribute as much as possible? How to keep them engaged? How to have the group feel responsible for their outcomes? How to have participants feel on charge instead of counting only on you to lead them at every moment?

We have found that you can achieve the above with the Delegated Missions 

The Delegated Missions are _five critical missions_ that participants volunteer to carry out for the benefit of the group. These five missions (facilitator, timekeeper, intent keeper, decision pusher, and meta-feedbacker) correspond to _five key ingredients of the success of any collective event_.

The delegated missions can bring your Event Storming sessions to a whole new level. When participants use the Delegated Missions in an Event Storming, they truly self-organize and maximize their Return.On.Time.Invested!

At this point, you are probably thinking:

>“It sounds great, but this is yet another new practice! How can I introduce it to my team?“

The good news is: we made it easy for you with [this DIY workshop]({{site.url}}/assets/2022-09-05-engage-the-participants-during-your-next-event-storming-thanks-to-the-delegated-missions/DIY workshop material ES & DM.zip)!
