_Here are step by step adaptations for a remote Event Storming. This is your checklist and walkthrough from Events Generation to Storytelling and beyond._

![Drawing of someone jumping in the "Remote Event Storming Pool". Your first remote Event Storming workshop will feel like jumping in a pool for the first time. This post is your guide to reassure you.]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/imgs/2025-03-30-remote-event-storming-made-easy-a-step-by-step-success-guide/remote-event-storming-pool.jpg)

Your first remote Event Storming will feel like jumping into the swimming pool to know if you can swim! Don‚Äôt worry, though; with this guide, you will discover that you have a foothold!

> Very concretely, I still don‚Äôt how to run a remote ES. I need final guidance for my first workshop!

Here is a remote Event Storming agenda, with detailed facilitation instructions. Follow the guide, and it will go well.

## Detailed agenda

> üí° What follows builds on previous posts that you could read for a refresher:

### Welcome

There are two extra points of attention when running Event Storming remotely:

- **Ask participants to turn on their webcams**. Depending on the culture of your organization, you might need to insist! You can use something like that: ‚Äú90% of Event Storming is about collaboration, and 60% of collaboration is non-verbal. So please turn on your webcams. Poor internet connection is a valid excuse, but it‚Äôs the only one!‚Äù
- Do a last call to ensure that everybody‚Äôs technical setup is working (check the previous post for details)

### Events Generation

This phase is solo work. It works almost as if co-located. The only difference is the usage of virtual stickies instead of paper.

### Sorting Events

This is when the collaboration starts! It‚Äôs also when you will use the [seven essential practices of remote Event Storming]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/remote%20facilitation/remote-event-storming-simplified-7-essential-practices/).

- First thing: if you haven‚Äôt done it before, it‚Äôs the **last opportunity to run a [collaboration practice session]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/remote%20facilitation/remote-event-storming-simplified-7-essential-practices/#make-participants-practice-first)**.
- To smooth out the sorting, you‚Äôll need to split the participants into [breakout rooms]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/remote%20facilitation/remote-event-storming-simplified-7-essential-practices/#regularly-break-out-into-topic-rooms):
  - Create arbitrary subgroups of 3 and ask them to **sort their events using [Silent Sorting]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/remote%20facilitation/remote-event-storming-simplified-7-essential-practices/#merge-work-with-silent-sorting)**.
  - If you have more than 15 participants, add an extra round of intermediate breakout rooms. You'll need to merge three subgroups of three into groups of nine manually. Then ask them to silent sort again.
  - When you call everyone back together, **give participants a moment to review the work of other groups silently**. Continue with [Silent Sorting]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/remote%20facilitation/remote-event-storming-simplified-7-essential-practices/#merge-work-with-silent-sorting) and only then open the discussion to complete the board.
  - Throughout, **visit the rooms** to monitor participants' progress and provide guidance as needed. (See the [Delegated Missions or the Mob Roles]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/remote%20facilitation/remote-event-storming-simplified-7-essential-practices/#assign-collaboration-roles) from the [7 Essential Practices]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/remote%20facilitation/remote-event-storming-simplified-7-essential-practices/).)
- Finally, as events find their place, make sure to [keep the board tidy]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/remote%20facilitation/remote-event-storming-simplified-7-essential-practices/#keep-the-board-self-explanatory)

### Adding Actors and External Systems

![Photo of an actor during a play. All good stories have actors and heroes, and it's the same in Event Storming!]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/imgs/2025-03-30-remote-event-storming-made-easy-a-step-by-step-success-guide/actor.jpg)

This step is typically **brief and straightforward**. In the spirit of [Silent Sorting]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/remote%20facilitation/remote-event-storming-simplified-7-essential-practices/#merge-work-with-silent-sorting), ask everyone to add Actors and External Systems to the design board. After a moment, ask participants to voice questions, disagreements, and counterproposals.

### Storytelling

The co-located way of **walking through the design board all together is a pain when remote**. Here is an alternative flow using subgroups.

- Split the participants into [breakout rooms]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/remote%20facilitation/remote-event-storming-simplified-7-essential-practices/#regularly-break-out-into-topic-rooms) according to the timeline. Create **separate rooms for each board section** and ask people to self-assign. It implies extra setup and facilitation: this is when a co-facilitator is helpful.
- End the breakout-room time by asking each group to come up with:
  - **Pink stickies for problems and questions**.
  - **Green stickies for decisions**.
- Run a [Shift and Share]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/remote%20facilitation/remote-event-storming-simplified-7-essential-practices/#regularly-break-out-into-topic-rooms) so that each group has the opportunity to visit the rest of the design board
- Finally, copy all the problem and decision stickies into two dedicated boards and take a short moment to review them.

You can use a similar approach when doing Reverse Storytelling.

### Follow up activities

From this point forward, the agenda for the event storming is more adaptive. Orient the workshop to **different activities depending on what is most valuable**. Some activities have their built-in workflow; in this case, stick to it. Otherwise, use [breakout rooms, problem and decision stickies, and the Shift and Share flow]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/remote%20facilitation/remote-event-storming-simplified-7-essential-practices/#regularly-break-out-into-topic-rooms). This is an excellent alternative to having everybody listening to a central ‚Äúdriver‚Äù. As the facilitator, it‚Äôs up to you to decide what topics the breakout rooms should have:

- You can use **sections of the board**, roughly following the timeline (for example, Storytelling)
- **Pink ‚Äúproblem‚Äù stickies** make great topics! A session of fixing pink stickies can be pretty effective.
- It can be a **pure open space**, where anyone pitches their topic for their room.
- It can also be a mix of the above: **an open space with a few pre-defined topics**.

Finally, here are two last advice to remember:

- Don‚Äôt forget to use [Silent Sorting]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/remote%20facilitation/remote-event-storming-simplified-7-essential-practices/#merge-work-with-silent-sorting) whenever subgroups have to merge their work.
- Visit the breakout rooms to make sure they are effective.

![Photo of a vegetal tunnel. Once you have setup the Event Storming on good tracks, and as long as you stick to the fundamental practices, the workshop is on good rails, and should work out fine!]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/imgs/2025-03-30-remote-event-storming-made-easy-a-step-by-step-success-guide/tunnel.jpg)

## Benefits

Again, the main benefit of following **this workflow is stressless facilitation**! Here's why:

- Use this post as a reference walkthrough for remote Event Storming facilitation.
- These facilitation recipes have been battle-tested.
- Bonus: this workflow makes some practices better than when co-located! Ex: reverse storytelling.

## You are ready to go

This is all there is to know to run a remote Event Storming! If you haven‚Äôt yet, you can send your invitations and start the preparation.

In the following posts, we will delve into the advanced challenges of remote facilitation. How to leverage the small sessions? How to keep people engaged?
