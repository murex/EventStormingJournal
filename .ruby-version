3.2
# Tentative upgrades log
## on Windows
## - 2.7.2 to 3.0.5 works with adaptation. First fails because there is no 'bundle' command, only 'bundle.cmd' which is incompatible with some of our scripts
##   Fixed when running bundler.cmd from the root of repo
## - 3.1.3 and 3.2.0 fails because Jekyll wants liquid 4, which does not support ruby 3.2 (https://github.com/github/pages-gem/issues/859)
